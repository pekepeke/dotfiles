# Converts a rar archive into a zip archive. Because fuck rar.

# Requires unrar, which is unfree software. While that certainly sucks,
# the goal of this script is to get rid of all the rar archives so you
# don't need unrar anymore.

# You can try to use this script with unrar-free, but since unrar-free
# can't read all rar archives (fuck closed formats), I can't guarantee
# that it will work.
